Running Tests
-------------

Tests are front end tests that look at the login flow through the GUI.

Project is built in Maven and uses Serenity BDD for reporting

Prerequisites
-------------

Tests assume a number of users exist in the system and are active (i.e. not inactive or locked)
For users see ticket in Jira #HPLBS-9

Currently set to run headless using PhantomJS.  PhantomJS must be installed and .exe on PATH

Jira Integration
----------------

For Jira integration add the details of a registered user in the serenity.properties file.  This will let the reports
add a link to the ticket in Jira.  For two way integration the reports link from running in conjunction can be added as
comments to the test that will give running feedback as to whether tests are passing or failing.

Environment Entry Point
-----------------------

Environment URL is set in the LoginPage page object

Running
-------

Tests run headless on PhantomJS currently.  To switch to Firefox in each test class change

@Managed(driver = "PhantomJS") --> @Managed(driver = "Firefox")

To run the tests it is a maven command from the terminal or during the integration phase of the build.

To run its a mvn clean verify
